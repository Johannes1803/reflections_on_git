How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it
in the diagram the way we do?
  Merging two branches combines them into one branch, combining the features
  from both branches. That is why, in the diagram the two branches become one.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs.
always doing merges manually?
