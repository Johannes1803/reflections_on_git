When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
a) If I work on several pcs
b) If I collaborate in a team ( way more important)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It would push commits, that are not ready for release yet (e.g.
  one commit in a new feature that is not fully implemented yet).
