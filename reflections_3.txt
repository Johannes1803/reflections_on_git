When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
a) If I work on several pcs
b) If I collaborate in a team ( way more important)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It would push commits, that are not ready for release yet (e.g.
  one commit in a new feature that is not fully implemented yet).

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
  If the repository is mine, or I have permission to directly modify it,
  I would clone it from github to my local machine.
  If I want to use a public repo, but don`t have permission to directly
  change it, forking would be the way to go.
  While cloning and forking work on entire repos, different branches exist within
  a repository.

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
  of the remote stored locally?
    I know where the local and the remote branch diverged. This enables
    merging if the two repos get out of sync, e.g. if I collaborate in a
    team.
